# This is a sort of "Diary" to keep up progress  

**Day 1**  
Got my setup working and made the first .iso file, atleast i thought so. Apparentely after loading into Virtualbox with that .iso it was just plain debian, nothing i added,
i even removed gnome on my last setup and yet its back, no kde plasma, no boykisser OS, no nothing. Real sad this is. I'm currently rather pissed about this, cause well..
We're back at square 1. Sorry for this lads. Boykissers, drop the mic... :(
