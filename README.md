# BoykisserOS

**Who are we?**
We are a team existing of 2 people:
Chris (main dev on BoykisserOS)
DoÄŸukan (creator of the website)

**What is BoykisserOS**
BoykisserOS is a Debian based Linux distro, but its uh.
Different than you're average distro.. Bit gay.. (no homo ofc)
But its a pretty nice distro, it will be using KDE plasma 5 or 6 (havent decided just yet)
But has some interesting stuff in there. Some easter eggs too for sure (gl finding those)
But for now it is a non-existent OS as it is still in the making (stay tuned!!!!!)

**Why?**
I started off with it as a joke for my friends, then decided to put it on r/unixporn,
the day later it had 600 upvotes and crazy demand for the ISO. So for that i will be making it for you silly goobers ;3

**When?**
I expect to be releasing an alpha version in the following weeks, and will continue building off of that myself and with support from you,
the community. 

**Gay?**
what do you think? ;3 <3333333333
