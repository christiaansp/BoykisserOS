# BoykisserOS

**Who are we?**  
We are a team existing of 2 people:  
Chris (main dev on BoykisserOS)  
Doğukan (creator of the website)

**What is BoykisserOS**  
BoykisserOS is a Debian-based Linux distro, but it's uh...  
Different than your average distro... Bit gay... (no homo ofc)  
But it's a pretty nice distro, it will be using KDE Plasma 5 or 6 (haven't decided just yet).  
It has some interesting stuff in there. Some easter eggs too for sure (gl finding those).  
But for now, it is a non-existent OS as it is still in the making (stay tuned!!!!!)

**Why?**  
I started off with it as a joke for my friends, then decided to put it on r/unixporn.  
The day later it had 600 upvotes and crazy demand for the ISO.  
So for that, I will be making it for you silly goobers ;3

**When?**  
I expect to be releasing an alpha version in the following weeks,  
and will continue building off of that myself and with support from you, the community. 

**Gay?**  
What do you think? ;3 <3333333333
